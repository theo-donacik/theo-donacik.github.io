    "fullDescription": "This simple game of 2048 replicates the original game's mechanics and includes multiple themes on top of the base game. This game served as a project to help get me familiar with TypeScript, implementing elements of object oriented design to represent the game board and more functional use effect hooks which are common in React-based web projects. The game uses browser local storage to keep a copy of the game state which is restored when the game loads to save a user's game from their last session.",
